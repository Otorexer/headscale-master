This project is **not meant for use in production**. It modifies the database of your Headscale installation and can potentially break it. Headscale does not recommend modifying the database directly.

# Headscale Master

This project introduces a new API for Headscale.

I developed this because I found that the existing Headscale API did not allow modifications to certain aspects, such as the IPv4 address, username, and more.
